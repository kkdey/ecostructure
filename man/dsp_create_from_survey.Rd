\title{Create dispersion fields from local species abundance data 
and associated GIS data source (shp files or geodatabase file).}
\usage{
dsp_create_from_survey(
  local_data,
  gis_data_type = "shp",
  shp_dir = NULL,
  gdb_dir = NULL,
  gdb_object = NULL,
  gdb_layer = "All_Species",
  gdb_species_feature = "SCINAME",
  raster_latlim = c(5, 50),
  raster_longlim = c(50, 120),

}
\arguments{
\item{local_data}{abundance site (row) x species (column) matrix/data frame.}

\item{gis_data_type}{One of c("shp","gdb"). Are the GIS data in seperate shapefiles 
or in a geodatabase file?}

\item{shp_dir}{The directory that contains shapefiles for all the
species in the local data matrix.}

\item{gdb_dir}{The directory that contains the geodatabase.}

\item{gdb_object}{The geodatabase can be read in ahead of time and provided as an sf object. 
This will dramatically reduce run time, especially useful if the function 
is to be run multiple times.}

\item{gdb_layer}{If layer name of the gdb file that contains the species distributions.}

\item{gdb_species_feature}{The name of the feature that contains the species names 
in the geodatabse.}

\item{raster_latlim}{The latitudinal range of the desired dispersion field.}

\item{raster_longlim}{The longitudinal range of the desired dispersion field.}

\item{raster_resolution}{The precision of the initial estimation provided to fasterize. 
fasterize tends to undercount small species ranges, so is required 
to keep at a low value in order detect species presence in a square degree cell.
Most users will not need to change, but increaseing this value will 
speed up the function but with potential for error.}

\item{base_local}{If the count of a species in a local site is less than base_local,
it is assumed to be absent from the site. The default is 0.
Non zero values may result from obsrvational or data
recording errors}

\item{optional_species_names}{If the column name corresponding to some species
does not match with the GIS data, the user might need
to replace it by another species name. In such a
scenario, instead of using column names, the user can
enter a new vector of names, which may be slight
modification on the species from the column of the data,
taking account of issues with non-matching species names
between shape files and the local data frame.}

\item{include_shp_attributes}{Each species range may be divided according to a number of 
attributes, e.g. breeding and non breeding layers, and building dispersion fields
may require only a subset of these attributes. The user can provide a 
string of attributes in order to build the dispersion field
based only on those species attributes. The vector must be in a format
that is read in by sf and must include an "x" in place of where the 
sf object will be manipulated in the function.  Default includes 
breeding and resident ranges for global birds based on reading 
GIS data from BirdLife International.}
}
\value{
Returns 3 lists. In each list, each element is a
dispersion field corresponding to the species present in the 
specific site to which it corresponds. The first list "matrix" 
contains each dispersion field as a matrix. The second list "raster" returns 
each dispersion field as a raster.  The third list "precise" returns 
each dispersion field at the high resolution of precision.  The names of the elements 
of each list are assigned as the row names of the input data matrix (sites).
}
\description{
Reads a data frame or a matrix of local site-species abundances,
with rows being sites and columns being species, along with GIS data files for
each of the species (may be more too) ocurring in the local data matrix. The function
produces a dispersion field of the regional presence pattern for each site in 
a user-specified latitudinal and longitudinal range.
