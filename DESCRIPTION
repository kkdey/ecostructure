Description: Provides tools to visualize and analyze structure from a site-species abundance data
using grade of membership models. Also provides functions to generate global abundance dispersion
fields and subsequent global abundance count matrices from a local site-species abundance data and
available shapefiles. Additionally, has functions to view how grades of membership or any feature
of the site varies with the relative distance profile of the sites and ordering of sites
(by some metadata- say elevation).
